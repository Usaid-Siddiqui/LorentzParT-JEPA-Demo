"""
Embedding loss for JEPA pretraining.

Computes MSE between LayerNorm-normalised prediction and target embeddings.
Normalising both vectors before the MSE loss is the standard JEPA trick to
prevent representation collapse: without it, the model can trivially minimise
the loss by mapping everything to the origin.

The return signature (total_loss, (total_loss,)) matches the (loss, components)
convention used by MaskedModelTrainer so JEPATrainer can reuse the same
checkpointing and logging infrastructure.
